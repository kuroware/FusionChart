PHP class for FusionChart that can be assigned chart attributes the PHP way instead of manually concantenating
or passing in a long JSON string of your chart attriubtes. The FusionChart object can then easily be printed out with the
correct JSON format for FusionChart with brackets and all the correct delimiters.

The class was tested for line charts mainly and has not been tested for other types of charts (thought I expect them to operate similarily). 

I do not create FusionCharts, you can view it at: http://www.fusioncharts.com/
